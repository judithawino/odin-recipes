                    <li>On a wooden board, place flour and salt on the flat surface and make a small well in the center of the pile.</li>
                    <li>Slowly pour olive oil into the center of the well as you gradually bring the flour into it. Keep mixing with your hands until it becomes a light sticky dough.</li>
                    <li>Continue to knead the dough as you gradually pour hot water on to it. Knead, add water, knead, add water etc. Continue until all the oil and water has been absorbed.</li>
                    <li>The dough should hold its shape and be extremely supple.</li>
                    <li>Portion the dough into four and roll each until 3mm thickness. Shape it into a circle.</li>
                    <li>Warm a large shallow pan until hot over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Place one circular dough in the pan at a time. Pan-fry for 2.5 minutes each side. Every time you flip the dough, gently brush olive oil onto it.</li>
                    <li>Keep cooking and flipping until the dough becomes golden brown on both sides.</li>
                    <li>Serve the chapatis warm.</li>
